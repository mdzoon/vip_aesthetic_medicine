        <h3>Where We Store Your Information</h3>
        <p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. We will do our best to protect your personal data, but cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
        <h3>Uses Made of the Information</h3>
        <p>We use information held about you in the following ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To ensure that content from the Site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer.</li>
            <li>To provide you with information or services that you request from us.</li>
            <li>To carry out our obligations arising from the Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, the Intellectual Property Policy, the Cookies Policy, the Fees Policy and the Returns Policy.</li>
            <li>To notify you about changes to our service.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have registered on the Site, we may occasionally update you on our latest products, news, special offers and events via e-mail. All registered users have the option to opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us. You can do this by clicking on the Unsubscribe link in any email communications that we might send you.</p>
        <h3>Disclosure of Your Information</h3>
        <p>We may disclose your personal information to third parties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the event that InimitableMe sells or buys any business or assets;</li>
                <li>If InimitableMe or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data which we hold about our customers may be one of the transferred assets; or,</li>
                <li>If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our Terms of Use; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of InimitableMe, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We may disclose aggregate, anonymised statistics about the number of visitors to the Site or number and value of purchases made as required by current or prospective investors and partners. Such statistics may include information about visits to pages on the site, the duration of individual page views, paths taken by visitors through the site, data on visitors’ screen settings and other general information. InimitableMe uses and stores this type of information, as with that obtained from other cookies used on the site, to help it improve the services to its users.</p>
        <h3>Your Rights</h3>
        <p>We will not sell your name, address, e-mail address, credit or debit card information or personal information to any third party without your permission.</p>
        <p>If you wish to verify the details you have submitted to InimitableMe you may do so by contacting us via the e-mail address or address given below. Our security procedures mean that we may request proof of identity before we reveal information. This proof of identity will take the form of your e-mail address and password submitted upon registration. You must therefore keep this information safe as you will be responsible for any action which we take in response to a request from someone using your e-mail and password. We would strongly recommend that you do not use the browser’s password memory function as that would permit other people using your terminal to access your personal information.</p>
        <p>You have the right to access the information that InimitableMe holds about you and your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.</p>
        <h3>Your Use of Information</h3>
        <p>As part of a transaction, you may obtain personal information, including email address and shipping information, from another InimitableMe user. Without obtaining prior permission from that user, you may only use that personal information for the purpose of completing that transaction or for InimitableMe related communications. You may not use that personal information for unsolicited commercial messages. Without limiting the foregoing, without obtaining prior permission from that user, you may not add any InimitableMe user to any email or physical mailing list.</p>
        <h3>Third Party Sites</h3>
        <p>The Site may contain links to and from the websites of our partners, advertisers and other third parties. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that they have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.</p>
